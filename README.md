## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sahrudaya.git
cd sahrudaya
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Admin login configuration

Add these variables to `.env` before starting the server. Use a long random value for `SESSION_SECRET` and do not commit `.env`.

```env
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=replace-with-a-bcrypt-hash
SESSION_SECRET=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# SMTP for registration, event, verification, and password reset emails
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=your-smtp-username
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-smtp-password
SMTP_FROM=SAHRUDAYA <your-sender@example.com>
```

Generate a hash for a new password with `node -e "require('bcrypt').hash('your-password', 12).then(console.log)"`, then put the result in `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`. Login attempts are limited to five failed attempts per IP address every 15 minutes.

### Member email setup

The server sends registration confirmations with verification links, password reset links, and new event announcements to verified members. For Gmail, set `SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com`, `SMTP_PORT=465`, `SMTP_SECURE=true`, `SMTP_USER` to the Gmail address, and `SMTP_PASSWORD` to a Google App Password. The older `GMAIL_USER` and `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` variables remain supported as a Gmail-only fallback. Do not use a normal Gmail password or commit `.env`.

If SMTP variables are not configured, the server prints verification and reset links in the terminal for local development instead. Event notifications require SMTP to be configured.

Open `http://localhost:3000/admin` to sign in. The admin dashboard and the `GET /api/contacts` endpoint require an authenticated session.

### Gallery image uploads

After signing in, admins can upload JPEG, PNG, WebP, or GIF images up to 5 MB from the dashboard. Images are stored in the PostgreSQL `gallery_images` table and appear in the public gallery automatically.

### 3. Database Setup (Neon PostgreSQL)

Ensure your Neon database is active online and configure your local environment variable.

Default environment variable setup in `.env`:

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@ep-xxxx.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require

### 4. Run the application

```bash
npm start
```

Open your browser and visit:

```
http://localhost:3000
```
